--------------------------------

LOCALLY:

	-> Create a folder with project name(Later on Repository name).
	
	-> initialise git by "git init" command under that folder.

	-> Through "ls -a", we can see all the hidden files. Now we can see a .git.

	-> this .git will be used to commit and everything for the version control.

	-> to see what's currently inside the staging area, "git status".
	
	-> In order to add a file to a staging area and track changes in it, "git add file_name" or If we want to select all files for adding to staging area, "git add ."

	-> Now, we can commit this change, to commit with added message, "git commit -m "First Commit""

	-> We can see what commit we have made by using the "git log"
	
	->
