Working Remotely, GitHUB:
--------------------------

-> Create A new Repository in the GITHUB account.

-> Now After Creating the repo, go under the local repository.

-> To push the commits to the gitHUB:

	-> Create a Remote. Origin is simply the name of the remote. We can use anything in place of Origin. But by convention, it is named "origin".
	
		command: git remote add origin "url"

-> Now the remote is created, and now we can push the local repository to remote repo.

-> to push the repo, we can use "git push -u origin master"
